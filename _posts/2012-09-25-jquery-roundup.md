###jQuery 1.8.2

[jQuery 1.8.2](http://blog.jquery.com/2012/09/20/jquery-1-8-2-released/) is out, and new users of the 1.8 line are advised to read the jQuery Blog posts for [1.8](http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/09/jquery-1-8-released/) and [1.8.1](http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/30/jquery-1-8-1-released/) before upgrading.  This version adds a lot of fixes to the selector engine's pseudo class handling, including `:first`, `:last`, `:nth-child`, `:not`, and `:contains`.

###jQuery UK

[jQuery UK 2013](http://blog.jquery.com/2012/09/19/jquery-uk-2013/) has been announced for the 19th of April in Oxford.  Early bird ticket will be &pound;160, but there are also 'blind bird' tickets available for &pound;130.

###JavaScript Conference 2012

While we're on the topic of conferences, [JavaScript Conference 2012](http://www.javascript-conference.com/) takes place on the 15th and 16th of October 2012 in DÃ¼sseldorf.  There are several tiers of tickets available, and the main conference ticket costs &euro;590.

There's a talk on jQuery Mobile and a few on Sencha's various technologies.  I also noticed a Backbone.js talk, and one on Node as well.  The [speakers page](http://www.javascript-conference.com/speakers) has details on all of the talks and workshops.
