In one week, 415 people entered the [Node Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/node-to-guide-in-the-art-of-asynchronous-server-side-javascript-cookbook/book) giveaway.  I feel guilty that we only have five books to give out!  From this I can only assume that there's a huge amount of interest in Node, or people thought it was a new kind of molecular gastronomy.  Either way, here are the winners:

* Francesco Lentini
* De Bollivier SÃ©bastien
* Jason Serovi
* Janghwan Kim
* Joakim Bengtson

Winners will be contacted through email by Packt (@packtpub.com) and will receive a digital copy of the book.

Coincidentally, I also won a book this week.  It was [Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought](http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim), and I reviewed it over at usevim.com: [Book Review: Practical Vim](http://usevim.com/2012/10/31/practical-vim-review/).  Vim is my editor of choice, and I've been running [usevim.com](http://usevim.com/) alongside DailyJS for a few months now.  Check it out, and if you prefer Emacs I'm cool with that too!
