###jquery.snipe

</div>

[jquery.snipe](http://rayfranco.github.com/jquery.snipe/) (GitHub: [RayFranco / jquery.snipe](https://github.com/RayFranco/jquery.snipe), License: _Apache 2.0_, Component: `RayFranco/jquery.snipe`) by Franco Bouly shows a pleasing lens effect over images that follows the mouse.  The "zoom" image is separate, so effects can be created -- Franco's examples have black and white images with a colour image for the zoom.

Note that Franco's example image is slightly risqu√© -- it's perfectly safe for work in the DailyJS office but it might not be elsewhere.

###Photobooth.js

[Photobooth.js](http://wolframhempel.github.com/photobooth-js/) (GitHub: [WolframHempel / photobooth-js](https://github.com/WolframHempel/photobooth-js), License: _BSD_) by Wolfram Hempel is an API for working with webcams.  It currently works in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera -- browsers that support `navigator.getUserMedia`.  It can be used like a class or through jQuery.  It supports hue, saturation, and brightness adjustments and image resizing.

###jHERE

The map service used is [Here](http://developer.here.net/) from Nokia.
