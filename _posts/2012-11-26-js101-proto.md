When I originally wrote about prototypes in [JS101: Prototypes](http://dailyjs.com/2012/05/21/js101-prototype/) a few people were confused that I didn't mention the `__proto__` property.  One reason I didn't mention it is I was sticking to standard ECMAScript for the most part, using the [Annotated ECMAScript 5.1](http://es5.github.com/) site as a reference.  It's actually hard to talk about prototypes without referring to `__proto__`, though, because it serves a very specific and useful purpose.

Recall that objects are created using constructors:

{% highlight javascript %}
function User() {
}

var user = new User();
{% endhighlight %}

The `prototype` property can be used to add properties to instances of `User`:

{% highlight javascript %}
function User() {
}

User.prototype.greet = function() {
  return 'hello';
};

var user = new User();
user.greet();
{% endhighlight %}

So far so good.  The original constructor can be referenced using the `constructor` property on an instance:

{% highlight javascript %}
assert.equal(user.constructor, User);
{% endhighlight %}

However, `user.prototype` is not the same as `User.prototype`.  What if we wanted to get hold of the original prototype where the `greet` method was defined based on an instance of a `User`?

That's where `__proto__` comes in.  Given that fact, we now know the following two statements to be true:

{% highlight javascript %}
assert.equal(user.constructor, User);
assert.equal(user.__proto__, User.prototype);
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, `__proto__` doesn't appear in ECMAScript 5 -- so where does it come from?  As noted by the [documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto) it's a non-standard property.   Or is it?  It's included in [Ecma-262 Edition 6](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts#draft_specification_for_es.next_ecma-262_edition_6), which means whether it's standard or not depends on the version of ECMAScript that you're using.

It follows that an instance's constructor should contain a reference to the constructor's prototype.  If this is true, then we can test it using these assertions:

{% highlight javascript %}
assert.equal(user.constructor.prototype, User.prototype);
assert.equal(user.constructor.prototype, user.__proto__);
{% endhighlight %}

The standards also define [Object.getPrototypeOf](http://es5.github.com/#x15.2.3.2) -- this returns the _internal property_ of an object.  That means we can use it to access the constructor's prototype:

{% highlight javascript %}
assert.equal(Object.getPrototypeOf(user), User.prototype);
{% endhighlight %}

Putting all of this together gives this script which will pass in Node and Chrome (given a suitable assertion library):

{% highlight javascript %}
var assert = require('assert');

function User() {
}

var user = new User();

assert.equal(user.__proto__, User.prototype);
assert.equal(user.constructor, User);
assert.equal(user.constructor.prototype, User.prototype);
assert.equal(user.constructor.prototype, user.__proto__);
assert.equal(Object.getPrototypeOf(user), User.prototype);
{% endhighlight %}

###Internal Prototype

The confusion around `__proto__` arises because of the term __internal prototype__:

> All objects have an internal property called \[\[Prototype]]. The value of this property is either `null` or an object and is used for implementing inheritance.

Internally there _has_ to be a way to access the constructor's prototype to correctly implement inheritance -- whether or not this is available to us is another matter.  Why is accessing it useful to us?  In the wild you'll occasionally see people setting an object's `__proto__` property to make objects look like they inherit from another object.  This [used to be the case in Node's assertion module](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/b207e24bcd168a5ca538476ee0b3b0960cdc6759/lib/assert.js), but Node's `util.inherits` method is a more idiomatic way to do it:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Compare to: assert.AssertionError.__proto__ = Error.prototype;
util.inherits(assert.AssertionError, Error);
{% endhighlight %}

This was changed in [assert: remove unnecessary use of \_\_proto__](https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/9eddaebb79ff1954b7ecdb209587d7db6554580d).

###The Constructor's Prototype

The `User` example's internal prototype is set to `Function.prototype`:

{% highlight javascript %}
assert.equal(User.__proto__, Function.prototype);
{% endhighlight %}

If you're about to put on your hat, pick up your briefcase, and walk right out the door: hold on a minute.  You're coming to the end of the chain -- the prototype chain that is:

{% highlight javascript %}
assert.equal(User.__proto__, Function.prototype);
assert.equal(Function.prototype.__proto__, Object.prototype);
assert.equal(Object.prototype.__proto__, null);
{% endhighlight %}

Remember that the `__proto__` property is the _internal prototype_ -- this is how JavaScript's inheritance chain is implemented.  Every `User` inherits from `Function.prototype` which in turn inherits from `Object.prototype`, and `Object.prototype`'s internal prototype is `null` which allows the inheritance algorithm to know it has reached the end of the chain.

Therefore, adding a method to `Object.prototype` will make it available to every object.  [Properties of the Object Prototype Object](http://es5.github.com/#x15.2.4) include `toString`, `valueOf`, and `hasOwnProperty`.  That means instances of the `User` constructor in the previous example will have these methods.

###Pithy Closing Remark

JavaScript's inheritance model is not class-based.  Joost Diepenmaat's post, [Constructors considered mildly confusing](http://joost.zeekat.nl/constructors-considered-mildly-confusing.html), summarises this as follows:

> In a class-based object system, typically classes inherit from each other, and objects are instances of those classes. ... constructors do nothing like this: in fact constructors have their own \[\[Prototype]] chain completely separate from the \[\[Prototype]] chain of objects they initialize.

Rather than visualising JavaScript objects as "classes", try to think in terms of two parallel lines of _prototype chains_: one for constructors, and one for initialised objects.
