I've includes some question suggestions from readers Todd Bashor, Tyler Larson, and Adam Alexander.

If you can share this survey on social networking sites, or your favourite news site, then I'd appreciate it.  As always this survey is open in the sense that responses are public, so you can use the data to develop related open source or commercial projects.
