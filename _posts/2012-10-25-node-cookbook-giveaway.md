Packt Publishing has five copies of [Node Cookbook by David Mark Clements](http://www.packtpub.com/node-to-guide-in-the-art-of-asynchronous-server-side-javascript-cookbook/book) to give away.  Node Cookbook is a recipe-style book that aims to teach you everything you need to able to publish modules with npm, work with databases, handle streams, and also includes plenty of coverage on web development with Express.

If you're a client-side developer looking to learn more about Node, then it's a great jumping off point.
