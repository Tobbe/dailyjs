Enyo is a mobile and desktop framework that uses JavaScript and HTML5.  Developed by HP and the open source community, it's licensed under the Apache License.  If you're looking to build mobile applications with JavaScript, then Enyo is a great choice.  In this tutorial series, I'll introduce the major concepts through some worked examples that you can build or download and try out. The Enyo styleguide is suggesting double quotes instead of single quotes. Enyo also uses tabs for indentation. Although I prefer 2 Spaces as indentation and single quotes, I will follow these rules during this tutorial.

###Kinds

Enyo applications are built around object prototypes called `kinds`. These can be either `components` or `controls`. Kinds in Enyo are very modularized, reusable and encapsulated.

Controls, on the other hand, are for controlling DOM nodes and manipulating them. Controls can nest other controls or components -- they're the "building blocks" for applications. A good example would be an app consuming an XML feed: a component would process the feed to JSON and rearrange the data. The views of that application representing the feed would be controls.

###The Tip Calculator

There are hundreds of tip calculator apps on all the major vendor-specific app stores.  We can go one better though -- let's build a tip calculator that can run on pretty much anything.  Also, our Enyo-based app will be publishable using Cordova (formerly PhoneGap).

###Setup

The Enyo project provides Bootplate -- Enyo's template project. All we have to do is clone the repository and `init` the submodules:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/enyojs/bootplate.git
cd bootplate
git submodule update --init
{% endhighlight %}

###First Steps

Next open `debug.html`. You should now see the example app. In our developer console, type the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
new enyo.Control({ content: 'Hello World' }).write();
{% endhighlight %}

This creates an Enyo control. It's rendered as a simple `div`:

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="control">Hello World</div>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

###Going Deeper: Controls, Getter and Setter, Events

To start developing the tip calculator, delete the contents of `source/App.js` -- we'll replace it with a new file.

Let's add a `kind` called `App` to our emptied `App.js`:

{% highlight javascript %}
enyo.kind({
  name: "App",
  kind: enyo.Control,
  style: "",
  classes: "onyx",
  components: [
    {kind: "onyx.InputDecorator", components: [
      {kind: "onyx.Input", name: "sumControl", placeholder: "Enter sum"}
    ]},
    {kind: "onyx.InputDecorator", components: [
      {kind: "onyx.Input", name: "percentControl", placeholder: "Enter percent"}
    ]},
    {kind: "onyx.Button", content: "Calculate tip", ontap: "calculate"},
    {tag: "div", name: "tipAmount"}
  ],
  create: function() {
    this.inherited(arguments);
  },
  calculate: function(inSource, inEvent) {
    var sum = this.$.sumControl.hasNode().value;
    var percent = this.$.percentControl.hasNode().value;

    var result = (sum * percent) / 100;
    this.$.tipAmount.setContent(result);

    return true; // stop bubbling
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

An instance is created and rendered into the DOM in our `debug.html` file with `renderInto`:

{% highlight javascript %}
new App().renderInto(document.body);
{% endhighlight %}

Now I'll explain the previous example in detail.  The `kind` property is set to `enyo.Control`, and there are currently no inline styles -- the `style` property is empty.  The `onyx` CSS class should be added, which is an included submodule in the Bootplate that themes our Enyo application and the applications elements.

The `components` property is used to nest more __kinds__ -- I've used several to define the required input controls, a button, and a `div` to display the results.  All of these components have a `name` property, which is important and will be explained later.

The button has an event attached, the `tap`-event. Enyo supports many other events, e.g. dragging over the screen, `flick`, or self-created events.

When a `kind` is created the method `create` is automatically called by the Enyo framework. The method inherits from its parent kind with `this.inherited(arguments);` and can be overwritten. There are several other constructor and constructor-like functions in the lifecycle of a `kind`: `destroy`, `create` or `constructor`. We will use them in part 2 of this series.

Every time we tap our button the `calculate` method is called. `this.$` is used to address and access controls within the kind.

{% highlight javascript %}
var sum = this.$.sumControl.hasNode().value
{% endhighlight %}

This line is where the value of the control with the name `sumControl` is accessed.  After that we calculate the tip and render the result into the element.

{% highlight javascript %}
this.$.tipAmount.setContent(result);
{% endhighlight %}

Every control has some handy getters and setters:

{% highlight javascript %}
.setContent();
.getContent();
.getClasses();
.setClasses();
.getStyle();
.setStyle();
.getAttribute();
.setAttribute();
{% endhighlight %}

At the end of the method `return true` is used to prevent the tap event from bubbling up.

###Conclusion

We've now hacked together a very basic tip calculator.  This example could be built on to add a canvas element for diagrams, `localStorage` for statistics, or simply to add validation to user input.

In the next part of this series we'll have a closer look at components and exposing the published properties of kinds.  We'll also create more reusable components from our app.
