[Fuel UX](http://exacttarget.github.com/fuelux) (GitHub: [ExactTarget / fuelux](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux), License: _MIT_) extends the revolutionary [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) with some additional JavaScript controls. One of these controls is the Datagrid, and today I'm going to show you how to add the Datagrid to a page and connect it to a third party API.

[![Demo](/images/posts/fuel-ux-flickrgrid.png)](http://adamalex.github.com/fuelux-dgdemo/)

###Step One: Basic Fuel UX Page

There are a couple of resources I recommend for getting started with a basic Fuel UX page:

* [Fuel UX a library that extends Twitter Bootstrap](http://erjjones.github.com/blog/FuelUX-a-library-that-extends-twitter-bootstrap/) by [Eric Jones](https://twitter.com/erjjones)
* [Fuel UX - Getting Started](http://code.exacttarget.com/devcenter/fuel-ux/getting-started) on ExactTarget's [CODE@ Dev Center](http://code.exacttarget.com/devcenter/home)

Once you have Fuel UX on your page, you're ready to add the Datagrid!

###Step Two: Adding the Datagrid

Just like in Bootstrap, you can add most Fuel UX controls to a page by simply adding some markup and they will be instantiated automatically.

**[View the markup for this example](https://github.com/adamalex/fuelux-dgdemo/blob/02ff73d78404ce2d8af46d0905158c67a502db79/index.html#L60-101)**

Since the Datagrid needs to be connected to some data to be useful, we will need a little JavaScript to instantiate the control.

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#MyGrid').datagrid({
  dataSource: new FlickrDataSource({

    // Column definitions for Datagrid
    columns: [{
      property: 'image',
      label: 'Image',
      sortable: false
    },{
      property: 'title',
      label: 'Title',
      sortable: false
    }],

    // Create IMG tag for each returned image
    formatter: function (items) {
      $.each(items, function (index, item) {
        item.image = '<img src="' + flickrUrl(item) + '"></a>';
      });
    }
  })
});
{% endhighlight %}

###Step Three: Provide the Data Source

To connect the Datagrid to some data, we just need a data source to act as an adapter.  The data source's responsibilities are:

1. Provide column info
2. Provide data when requested by the Datagrid

For this example, I created a simple datasource to communicate with the Flickr API.

###Conclusion

I hope this tutorial is helpful in getting your own use of the Datagrid off the ground, and in using Fuel UX in general. The Fuel UX contributors and I are excited to have you on board! Next steps:
