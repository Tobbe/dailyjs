Let's end the week by learning about a software design principle that is easy to follow, yet a violation of it can cause bugs and coincidental correctness.

Command-query Separation (CQS) is the principle by which a method is defined to perform a query, execute a command, but never both. A *query* returns information about the state of the system, which can include anything from primitive data to objects, or even complex aggregation results. A *command*, on the other hand, changes the state of the system, usually by writing (persisting) modified objects or data. If we are working with a domain to manage `Person` objects a *query* method to find a person by name could be `PersonQuery.find(name)`, and a *command* to persist an instance could be `Person.apply()`.

###Normal Violations

While CQS is a sensible principle, it is violated in everyday practice. This is not as troublesome as it sounds, depending on the type of violation. Strict adherence to CQS makes some methods impossible such as query methods that count the number of invocations, thus allowing a developer to query the number of queries.

{% highlight javascript %}
/**
 * Finds a user by name and increments the
 * query counter.
 * @return the found Person or null if one was not found
 */
PersonQuery.prototype.find = function(name) {
  this._queriesPerformed++;

  // get the Person from the datasource or null if not found
  var person = this.dataSource.find("Person", name);
  return person;
};

/**
 * @return the number of queries performed.
 */
PersonQuery.prototype.getQueriesPerformed = function() {
  return this._queriesPerformed;
};
{% endhighlight %}

We could create an `incrementQueriesPerformed()` method instead of incrementing the counter within `find()`, but that would be excessive and burden the calling code.

{% highlight javascript %}
// now the developer must synchronize the state of PersonQuery. Yikes!
var person = personQuery.find("someuser");
personQuery.incrementQueryiesPerformed();
{% endhighlight %}

In practice, CQS is rarely taken in its pedantic form because doing so would make certain types of batched/transactional calls cumbersome.  Also, multi-threaded and asynchronous tasks would be difficult to coordinate.

Two classic violations are the `Stack.pop()` and `HashMap.remove()` methods as was the case in the [LinkedHashMap](http://dailyjs.com/2012/09/24/linkedhashmap/) article (inspired by Java's [Map interface](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html)).

{% highlight javascript %}
var map = new LinkedHashMap();
map.put('myNum', 5);

// ...

var val = map.remove('myNum');
alert(val); // prints "5"
{% endhighlight %}

The `remove()` method is both a command and query because it removes the value associated with the key (command) and returns the value, if any, that was associated with the key (query). While the violation is subtle, the same behavior could have been implemented with a `remove():void` method.

{% highlight javascript %}
var map = new LinkedHashMap();
map.put('myNum', 5);

// ...

var val = map.get('myNum');
map.remove('myNum');
alert(val); // prints "5"
{% endhighlight %}

As with many instances, the code to avoid CQS violation is clunky and overkill.

Although there are often violations of CQS at the method scale, many libraries violate CQS as an integral approach to their API design by combining both *getter* and *setter* behavior within the same method.

{% highlight javascript %}
var person = new Person("someuser");

// one possibility
person.enabled(true); // set enabled to true
var enabled = person.enabled(); // return true

// another possibility
person.value('enabled', true); // set enabled to true
var enabled = person.value('enabled'); // return true
{% endhighlight %}

I personally do not prefer this flavor of behavior overloading--instead recommending `getEnabled()` and `setEnabled(Boolean)`--but as long as the API is intuitive and documented then it's generally not a problem.

###Dangerous Violations

There are, however, instances where CQS violations cause side effects that can be difficult to debug. This usually happens when code tries to be too clever or helpful by merging command and query behavior.

Consider the following code to query and create a `Person`:

{% highlight javascript %}
var person = personQuery.find("someuser");
if (person === null) {
  person = new Person("someuser");
  person.apply(); // persisted
  console.log("Created the Person ["+person+"]");
} else {
  console.log("Person ["+person+"] already exists.");
}
{% endhighlight %}

The code attempts to find a `Person` and create one if it does not exist; further calls to `find()` will correctly return the `Person`. The logic is trivial and easy to understand, but imagine that a developer decides to reduce the effort by changing `find()` to create a Person if a result is not found.

{% highlight javascript %}
PersonQuery.prototype.find = function(name) {
  var person = this.dataSource.find("Person", name);

  if (person === null) {
    person = new Person(name);
    person.apply();
  }
  
  return person;
};
{% endhighlight %}

It can be argued that by combining both query and command behavior into `find()`, calling code can remove the `if/else` checks for *null*, thus making it simplier.

{% highlight javascript %}
var person = personQuery.find("someuser");
console.log("Person ["+person+"] exists.");
{% endhighlight %}

The amount of code has been reduced, but we must consider other circumstances in which `find()` will be called.

As an example, when a user is creating a new `Person` via a standard HTML form, the system calls `find()` to ensure the name is not already taken. When `find()` was just a query method it could be called any number of times without affecting the system. But now it creates the `Person` it is attempting to find so a uniqueness constraint violation will occur.

{% highlight javascript %}
// request one
var person = personQuery.find("newuser"); // returns newuser
if (person !== null) {
  alert("The name is already taken.");
}

// ... however, in a second request

// request two
var person = personQuery.find("newuser"); // Error (duplicate name)
if (person !== null) {
  // we can never reach this
  alert("The name is already taken.");
}
{% endhighlight %}

By adding command behavior to `find()`, the developer has accidentally broken the code. The original post-condition, the condition known to the code at the time, changed from *returns null if no match was found* to *creates a Person and returns it if no match was found*. Now the developer must spend time to refactor the original code, but maybe it's legacy or outside of his or her control. Care must be taken when changing method conditions.

One solution is to name the method more aptly to describe its behavior: `PersonQuery.findOrCreate()`. Then the method `find()` could be added as a pure query alternative, and calling code can choose which one to invoke under the circumstances.

Another solution is to not change `find()` at all. It worked before, and it will work in the future.

###Conclusion

Strict adherence to CQS is nearly impossible to achieve in normal application programming, although some special applications might require such an architecture.

What should be kept in mind is that a looser definition of CQS is valid and useful in practice. A method should stick to being a command or query, but if both behaviors are needed the method name should reflect its dual nature and a non-query/command alternative should be offered.
